# TataConsom Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for analysing the "TataConsom‚Äù dataset using Python and Machine Learning Algorithm. The dataset consists of various variables related to tradings. This is the unsupervised learning in machine learning. So in machine learning I used KMeans algorithm for this data set. Our goal is to explore, analysing, Machine learning and draw insights from this data.
## Dataset Description
The "TataConsom" dataset contains information about tradings. Each entry represents a unique dining experience and includes the following columns:

- **Date**: Date of the record
- **Open**:  The price at which a stock first trades upon the opening of the market session.
- **High**: The highest price at which a stock traded during the current trading session.
- **Low**: The lowest price at which a stock traded during the current trading session.
- **Prev.close**: The closing price of the stock from the previous trading session.
- **LTP**: The price at which the last trade for the stock occurred.
- **Close**: The closing price of the stock for the current trading session.
- **VWAP**: The average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price.
- **52W H**: The highest price at which the stock has traded over the last 52 weeks (1 year).
- **52 W L**: The lowest price at which the stock has traded over the last 52 weeks (1 year).
- **Volume**: The total number of shares traded during the current trading session
- **Value**:: The total value of all shares traded during the current trading session.
- **No of Traders**: The total number of individual transactions (buy/sell orders) executed during the current trading session.
